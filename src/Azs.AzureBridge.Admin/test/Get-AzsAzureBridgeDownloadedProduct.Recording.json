If Customer installs or uses the Software or keeps it for 30 days after the date of purchase (or the date of delivery, if A10 Networks has made the Software available to Customer without charge), then Customer has indicated that Customer understands this Agreement and accept all of its terms.  If you are accepting the terms of this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the terms of this Agreement, and, in such event, “Customer” will refer to that company or other legal entity.  If Customer does not accept all the terms of this Agreement, then A10 Networks is unwilling to license the Software to Customer, and Customer must return the Software to A10 Networks for a full refund, if Customer has paid for the license to the Software, or, if A10 Networks has made the Software available to Customer without charge, Customer must destroy all copies of the Software.  Customer’s right to return the Software for a refund expires 30 days after the date of purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\tGrant of License.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer has downloaded a trial version and has not paid the license fees, Customer’s license is limited to use for Customer internal business purposes solely in a non-production environment, and solely for the purpose of evaluating whether Customer will purchase a production-environment use license. Customer may make copies of the Software for backup purposes; provided that Customer reproduces on it all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the Software.

A10 Networks may, at its option, require return of the Software as a condition to the remedy. In no event does A10 Networks warrant that the Software is error free or that Customer will be able to operate the Software without problems or interruptions. A10 Networks does not warrant that the Software will meet Customer requirements, that the Software will operate in the combinations that Customer may select for Execution, that the operation of the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted, or that all Software errors will be corrected. In addition, due to the continual development of new techniques for intruding upon and attacking networks, A10 Networks does not warrant that the Software or any equipment, system or network on which the Software is used will be free of vulnerability to intrusion or attack. \\r\\n\\r\\nRestrictions.

TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY OF THE SAME CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH IMPLIED CONDITION, REPRESENTATION AND/OR WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD REFERRED TO IN THE “LIMITED WARRANTY” SECTION ABOVE.  NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM A10 NETWORKS OR ELSEWHERE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose. \\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\tLimitation of Liability.  A10 NETWORKS’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS PAID TO A10 NETWORKS BY CUSTOMER FOR THE SOFTWARE OR, IN THE EVENT THAT A10 NETWORKS HAS MADE THE SOFTWARE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER WITHOUT CHARGE, A10 NETWORKS’ TOTAL LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO $500.  IN NO EVENT WILL A10 NETWORKS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS, PROFITS OR ABILITY TO EXECUTE) OR FOR THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT A10 NETWORKS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  \\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\tU.S. Government Customers.

Consistent with FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the contrary in any agreement into which the Agreement may be incorporated, Customer may provide to Government Customer or, if the Agreement is direct, Government Customer will acquire, the Software with only those rights set forth in the Agreement. Use of either the Software constitutes agreement by the Government Customer that the Software and Documentation are “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.\\r\\n\\r\\n10.\\tCompliance with Laws.  Customer agrees to comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection with its activities under this Agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n11.\\tExport Administration Act and Related Laws.

In addition, Customer understands and agrees that A10 Networks\u0027 Software and Technology shall not, in the absence of authorization by United States and local law and regulations, as required, be used by or exported or re-exported to (i) any United States sanctioned or embargoed country, or to foreign nationals or residents of such countries; or (ii) any person, entity, organization or other party identified on the United States Department of Commerce\u0027s Denied Persons or Entity Lists, the United States Department of Treasury\u0027s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of State\u0027s Debarred Parties List, as published and revised from time to time; (iii) any party engaged in nuclear, chemical/biological weapons or missile proliferation activities; or (iv) any party for use in the design, development, or  production of rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles.  Customer warrants and represents that it is not (i) a person, entity, organization or other party identified on the United States Department of Commerce\u0027s Denied Persons or Entity List, the United States Department of Treasury\u0027s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of State\u0027s Debarred Parties List, as published and revised from time to time.   \\r\\n\\r\\n11.\\tIdentified Components; Additional Terms. The Software may contain or be delivered with one or more components, which may include third-party components, identified by A10 Networks in the documentation, readme.txt file, third-party click-accept or elsewhere (e.g. on www.a10networks.com) (the “Identified Component(s)”) as being subject to different license agreement terms, disclaimers of warranties, limited warranties or other terms and conditions (collectively, “Additional Terms”) than those set forth herein. Customer agrees to the applicable Additional Terms for any such Identified Component(s).\\r\\n\\r\\n12.\\tGeneral.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to or application of conflict of laws rules or principles.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.  Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without A10 Networks’ prior written consent, and any attempt by Customer to do so, without such consent, will be void.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise.  All notices or approvals required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by confirmed facsimile transmission, by overnight delivery service, or by certified mail, and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt.  All notices or approvals will be sent to the addresses set forth in the applicable ordering document or invoice or to such other address as may be specified by either party to the other in accordance with this section.  The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.  Any waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.  This Agreement is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all proposals, understandings or communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding its subject matter, unless Customer and A10 Networks have executed a separate agreement governing use of the Software.  Any terms or conditions contained in Customer purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement are hereby rejected by A10 Networks and will be deemed null.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. \\tNotices.\\r\\nTrademarks.

Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The existence or results of any negotiation, mediation or arbitration will be treated as confidential.

The arbitrator shall render his or her award in writing and will include the findings of fact and conclusion of law upon which his or her award is based. Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The existence or results of any negotiation, mediation or arbitration will be treated as confidential.

That audit is subject to reasonable notice by EMC and will not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities. EMC may conduct no more than one (1) audit in any twelve (12) month period, and only during normal business hours. Customer will reasonably cooperate with EMC and any third party auditor and will, without prejudice to other rights of EMC, address any non-compliance identified by the audit by promptly procuring additional licenses.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any dispute that remains unresolved following mediation shall be settled by arbitration administered by the JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.  The place of arbitration shall be Seattle, Washington.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator(s), all of its costs and fees.  \\\"Costs and fees\\\" mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators\u0027 fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys\u0027 fees.  In rendering the award, the arbitrator(s) shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties according to the substantive and procedural laws of the State of Washington.  The foregoing alternative dispute resolution provisions will not apply to claims or actions related to the infringement, misappropriation or violation of F5’s intellectual property rights or those of its third party licensors and such actions may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any other agreement relating to the Software, the terms set forth in this License shall control.  \\n\\t\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e13.\\tAcknowledgements.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any dispute that remains unresolved following mediation shall be settled by arbitration administered by the JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.  The place of arbitration shall be Seattle, Washington.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator(s), all of its costs and fees.  \\\"Costs and fees\\\" mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators\u0027 fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys\u0027 fees.  In rendering the award, the arbitrator(s) shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties according to the substantive and procedural laws of the State of Washington.  The foregoing alternative dispute resolution provisions will not apply to claims or actions related to the infringement, misappropriation or violation of F5’s intellectual property rights or those of its third party licensors and such actions may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any other agreement relating to the Software, the terms set forth in this License shall control.  \\n\\t\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e13.\\tAcknowledgements.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any dispute that remains unresolved following mediation shall be settled by arbitration administered by the JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.  The place of arbitration shall be Seattle, Washington.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator(s), all of its costs and fees.  \\\"Costs and fees\\\" mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators\u0027 fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys\u0027 fees.  In rendering the award, the arbitrator(s) shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties according to the substantive and procedural laws of the State of Washington.  The foregoing alternative dispute resolution provisions will not apply to claims or actions related to the infringement, misappropriation or violation of F5’s intellectual property rights or those of its third party licensors and such actions may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any other agreement relating to the Software, the terms set forth in this License shall control.  \\n\\t\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e13.\\tAcknowledgements.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

Any dispute that remains unresolved following mediation shall be settled by arbitration administered by the JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.  The place of arbitration shall be Seattle, Washington.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator(s), all of its costs and fees.  \\\"Costs and fees\\\" mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators\u0027 fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys\u0027 fees.  In rendering the award, the arbitrator(s) shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties according to the substantive and procedural laws of the State of Washington.  The foregoing alternative dispute resolution provisions will not apply to claims or actions related to the infringement, misappropriation or violation of F5’s intellectual property rights or those of its third party licensors and such actions may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any other agreement relating to the Software, the terms set forth in this License shall control.  \\n\\t\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e13.\\tAcknowledgements.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any other agreement relating to the Software, the terms set forth in this License shall control.  \\n\\t\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e13.\\tAcknowledgements.

Any provisions found to be unenforceable will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions contained herein, but will instead be replaced with a provision as similar in meaning to the original as possible.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter.  No modification will be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties.

For instance, if there is a NAT rule on port 50000, you can connect to that virtual machine by using RDP on port 50000 of the public ip address of the load balancer for Windows or ssh into that virtual machine using the command: ssh -p 50000 {user-name}@{public-ip-address}.\",\"publisherDisplayName\":\"Microsoft\",\"publisherIdentifier\":\"Microsoft\",\"provisioningState\":\"Succeeded\",\"offer\":\"VMSSGalleryItem\",\"offerVersion\":\"1.3.6\",\"sku\":\"VMSS\",\"billingPartNumber\":\"\",\"galleryItemIdentity\":\"microsoft.vmss.1.3.6\",\"iconUris\":{\"large\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/microsoft.vmss-1.3.6/57dfd2fa78c54057afdd8a51b6f83780/Large\",\"wide\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/microsoft.vmss-1.3.6/4a736b89482f470cb762273a69ba9705/Wide\",\"medium\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/microsoft.vmss-1.3.6/54fe5165106440eb94d19330eaa520d2/Medium\",\"small\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/microsoft.vmss-1.3.6/85269c7211c245c0935b54095e7ed55c/Small\"},\"links\":[{\"displayName\":\"Learn more\",\"uri\":\"http://aka.ms/vmssoverview\"},{\"displayName\":\"Documentation\",\"uri\":\"http://aka.ms/vmssdoc\"}],\"payloadLength\":41141,\"productKind\":\"virtualMachine\",\"productProperties\":{\"version\":\"1.3.6\"}}},{\"id\":\"/subscriptions/74c72bdc-d917-431c-a377-8ca80f4238a0/resourceGroups/azurestack-activation/providers/Microsoft.AzureBridge.Admin/activations/default/downloadedProducts/microsoft.windowsserver2008r2sp1-arm-byol-2.127.20180815\",\"name\":\"default/microsoft.windowsserver2008r2sp1-arm-byol-2.127.20180815\",\"type\":\"Microsoft.AzureBridge.Admin/activations/downloadedProducts\",\"etag\":\"W/\\\"datetime\u00272019-04-22T15%3A33%3A54.2405931Z\u0027\\\"\",\"properties\":{\"displayName\":\"Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 - BYOL use only\",\"description\":\"Windows Server 2008 R2 is a popular, multi-purpose server operating system that organizations around the globe trust to run their mission-critical workloads.\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 class=\u0027msportalfx-text-header\u0027\u003eLegal Terms\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy clicking the Download button, I acknowledge that I am getting this software from Microsoft and that the \u003ca href=\u0027https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825699\u0027 target=\u0027_blank\u0027\u003elegal terms\u003c/a\u003e of Microsoft apply to it.

If an Order indicates that Software is to be used by Customer for evaluation purposes, or if Software is otherwise obtained from Provider for evaluation purposes, Customer shall be granted a License to use such Software and the associated Documentation solely for Customer’s own non-production, internal evaluation purposes (an “Evaluation License”). Each Evaluation License shall be granted for an evaluation period of up to thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the On-Premise Software or from the date that access is granted to the SaaS Software, plus any extensions granted by Provider in writing (the \\\"Evaluation Period\\\"). There is no fee for an Evaluation License during the Evaluation Period, however, Customer is responsible for any applicable shipping charges or taxes which may be incurred, and any fees which may be associated with usage beyond the scope permitted herein.

Each permitted copy of the Software and Documentation made by Customer hereunder must contain all titles, trademarks, copyrights and restricted rights notices as in the original. Customer understands and agrees that the Products may work in conjunction with third party products and Customer agrees to be responsible for ensuring that it is properly licensed to use such third party products. Notwithstanding anything otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the terms and restrictions set forth herein shall not prevent or restrict Customer from exercising additional or different rights to any open source software that may be contained in or provided with the Products in accordance with the applicable open source software licenses which shall be either included with the Products or made available to Customer upon request. Customer may not use any license keys or other license access devices not provided by Provider, including but not limited to “pirate keys”, to install or access the Software. \\n\\n4.\\tProprietary Rights.

The fees stated in an Order may not include taxes. If Provider is required to pay sales, use, property, value-added or other taxes based on the Products or Maintenance Services provided under this Agreement or on Customer’s use of Products or Maintenance Services, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by Customer. This Section does not apply to taxes based on Provider’s income.\\n\\n8.  \\tTermination.  \\n\\nThis Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder may be terminated (i) by mutual written agreement of Provider and Customer or (ii) by either party for a breach of this Agreement by the other party (or a Third Party User) that the breaching party fails to cure to the non-breaching party’s reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days following its receipt of notice of the breach.\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement or expiration or termination of a License for any reason, all rights granted to Customer for the applicable Software shall immediately cease and Customer shall immediately: (i) cease using the applicable Software and Documentation, (ii) remove all copies, installations, and instances of the applicable Software from all Customer computers and any other devices on which the Software was installed, and ensure that all applicable Third Party Users and Clients do the same, (iii) return the applicable Software to Provider together with all Documentation and other materials associated with the Software and all copies of any of the foregoing, or destroy such items, (iv) cease using the Maintenance Services associated with the applicable Software, (v) pay Provider or the applicable Partner all amounts due and payable up to the date of termination, and (vi) give Provider a written certification, within ten (10) days, that Customer,  Third Party Users, and Clients, as applicable, have complied with all of the foregoing obligations. \\n\\nAny provision of this Agreement that requires or contemplates execution after (i) termination of this Agreement, (ii) a termination or expiration of a License, or (iii) the expiration of a SaaS Term, is enforceable against the other party and their respective successors and assignees notwithstanding such termination or expiration, including, without limitation, the Restrictions, Payment, Taxes, Termination, Survival, Warranty Disclaimer, Infringement Indemnity, Limitation of Liability, Confidential Information, Compliance Verification, and General Sections of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement or a License shall be without prejudice to any other remedies that the terminating party may have under law, subject to the limitations and exclusions set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n9.  \\tExport. Customer acknowledges that the Products and Maintenance Services are subject to the export control laws, rules, regulations, restrictions and national security controls of the United States and other applicable foreign agencies (the \\\"Export Controls\\\") and agrees to abide by the Export Controls. Customer hereby agrees to use the Products and Maintenance Services in accordance with the Export Controls, and shall not export, re-export, sell, lease or otherwise transfer the Products or any copy, portion or direct product of the foregoing in violation of the Export Controls.  Customer is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses or authorizations relating to the export, re-export, sale, lease or transfer of the Products and for ensuring compliance with the requirements of such licenses or authorizations. Customer hereby (i) represents that Customer is not an entity or person to which shipment of Products, or provision of Maintenance Services, is prohibited by the Export Controls; and (ii) agrees that it shall not export, re-export or otherwise transfer the Products to (a) any country subject to a United States trade embargo, (b) a national or resident of any country subject to a United States trade embargo, (c) any person or entity to which shipment of Products is prohibited by the Export Controls, or (d) anyone who is engaged in activities related to the design, development, production, or use of nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons, missiles or chemical or biological weapons. Customer shall, at its expense, defend Provider and its Affiliates from any third party claim or action arising out of any inaccurate representation made by Customer regarding the existence of an export license, Customer’s failure to provide information to Provider to obtain an export license, or any allegation made against Provider due to Customer’s violation or alleged violation of the Export Controls (an “Export Claim”) and shall pay any judgments or settlements reached in connection with the Export Claim as well as Provider’s costs of responding to the Export Claim.\\n\\n10.   Maintenance Services. \\n\\n(a) \\tDescription. Except as otherwise stated in a Signed Order or Governing Quotation, or an amendment to this Agreement, during any Maintenance Period and for the applicable fees, Provider shall: \\n\\n\\t(i)\\tMake available to Customer new versions and releases of the Software, including Software corrections, enhancements and upgrades, if and when Provider makes them generally available without charge as part of Maintenance Services. \\n\\n\\t(ii)\\tRespond to communications from Customer that report Software failures not previously reported to Provider by Customer. Nothing in the foregoing shall operate to limit or restrict follow up communication by Customer regarding Software failures. \\n\\n\\t(iii)\\tRespond to requests from Customer’s technical coordinators for assistance with the operational/technical aspects of the Software unrelated to a Software failure. Provider shall have the right to limit such responses if Provider reasonably determines that the volume of such non-error related requests for assistance is excessive or overly repetitive in nature.\\n \\n    (iv)\\tProvide access to Provider’s software support web site at http://quest.com/support/ (the “Support Site”). \\n    \\n    (v)\\tFor Customers that have purchased a License to use Software in the “Privileged Account” family of products (“PA Software”) and have purchased Maintenance Services for the PA Software continuously since the purchase of such License, provide the Privileged Account Appliance Replacement Program (as described in the Product Guide) for the Appliance on which the PA Software is delivered (the “PA Appliance”).\\n    \\n\\nMaintenance Services are available during regional business support hours (“Business Hours”) as indicated on the Support Site, unless Customer has purchased 24x7 Support. The list of Software for which 24x7 Support is available and/or required is listed in the Global Support Guide on the Support Site.    \\n\\nThe Maintenance Services for Software that Provider has obtained through an acquisition or merger may, for a period of time following the effective date of the acquisition or merger, be governed by terms other than those in this Section. The applicable different terms, if any, shall be stated on the Support Site.\\n\\n(b)\\tMaintenance Period. For On-Premise Software, the first period for which Customer is entitled to receive Maintenance Services begins on the date of the initial delivery of the Software following an Order and ends twelve (12) months thereafter unless otherwise set forth below or in the applicable Signed Order or Governing Quotation (the “Initial Maintenance Period”). Following the Initial Maintenance Period, Maintenance Services for On-Premise Software shall automatically renew for additional terms of twelve (12) months (each, a “Renewal Maintenance Period”) at the prices stated on the Maintenance renewal Quotation unless the renewal has been cancelled by either party giving written notice, by email or otherwise, to the other at least sixty (60) days prior to the first day of the applicable Renewal Maintenance Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the Initial Maintenance Period and each Renewal Maintenance Period shall be considered a “Maintenance Period.”  For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall apply to each Renewal Maintenance Period.  Cancellation of Maintenance Services for perpetual Licenses for On-Premise Software will not terminate Customer’s rights to continue to use the On-Premise Software. Maintenance fees shall be due in advance of each Renewal Maintenance Period and shall be subject to the payment requirements set forth in this Agreement. The procedure for reinstating Maintenance Services for On-Premise Software after it has lapsed is posted at https://support.quest.com/essentials/Reinstate-Maintenance-Services. \\n\\nFor SaaS Software, the Maintenance Period is equal to the duration of the applicable SaaS Term. For non-perpetual Licenses for On-Premises Software or for non-perpetual MSP Licenses, the Maintenance Period is equal to the duration of the License.\\n\\n\\n11.  \\tWarranties and Remedies.  \\n\\n(a)\\tSoftware Warranties.  Provider warrants that, during the applicable Warranty Period (as defined in subsection (c) below), \\n\\n    (i) \\tthe operation of the Software, as provided by Provider, will substantially conform to its Documentation (the “Operational Warranty”); \\n    \\n    (ii) \\tthe Software, as provided by Provider, will not contain any viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, or other malicious or destructive code designed by Provider to allow unauthorized intrusion upon, disabling of, or erasure of the Software, except that the Software may contain a key limiting its use to the scope of the License granted, and license keys issued by Provider for temporary use are time-sensitive (the “Virus Warranty”);  \\n\\n    (iii)\\tthe media provided by Provider, if any, on which the On-Premise Software is recorded will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship under normal use (the “Media Warranty”); and \\n    (iv)\\tit will make commercially reasonable efforts to make the SaaS Software available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week except for scheduled maintenance, the installation of updates, those factors that are beyond the reasonable control of Provider, Customer’s failure to meet any minimum system requirements communicated to Customer by Provider, and any breach of this Agreement by Customer that impacts the availability of the SaaS Software (the “SaaS Availability Warranty”).\\n\\n(b)\\tAppliance Warranties. Except for the PA Appliance, Appliances are warranted in accordance with the warranty document delivered with the Appliance and/or included on the hardware manufacturers’ website. For the PA Appliance, Provider warrants that, during the applicable Warranty Period, the PA Appliance will operate in a manner which allows the PA Software to be used in substantial conformance with the Documentation (the “PA Appliance Warranty”).\\n\\n(c)\\tWarranty Periods. The “Warranty Period” for each of the above warranties shall be as follows: (i) for the Operational Warranty as it applies to On-Premise Software, the Virus Warranty and the Media Warranty, thirty (30) days following the initial delivery of the Software pursuant to an Order; (ii) for the Operational Warranty as it applies to SaaS Software and the SaaS Availability Warranty, the duration of the SaaS Term; and (iii) for the PA Appliance Warranty, one (1) year following the initial delivery of the PA Appliance following an Order. \\n\\n(d)\\tRemedies.

The warranties set forth in this Section shall not apply to any non-conformance (i) that Provider cannot recreate after exercising commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to do so; (ii) caused by misuse of the applicable Product or by using the Product in a manner that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the Documentation; or (iii) arising from the modification of the Product by anyone other than Provider. \\n\\n(f)  Third Party Products.  Certain Software may contain features designed to interoperate with third-party products.  If the third-party product is no longer made available by the applicable provider, Provider may discontinue the related product feature. Provider shall notify Customer of any such discontinuation, however Customer will not be entitled to any refund, credit or other compensation as a result of the discontinuation.  \\n\\n(g)\\tWarranty Disclaimer. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION OR IN A SIGNED ORDER OR GOVERNING QUOTATION ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES PROVIDED BY PROVIDER HEREUNDER. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR REMEDIES ARE EXCLUDED, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE. PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCTS.\\n\\n(h)\\tHigh-Risk Disclaimer. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY HIGH-RISK OR HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, OR ANY OTHER APPLICATION WHERE THE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF ANY PRODUCT CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE OR SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM (A “HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT”). ACCORDINGLY, (I) CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT USE THE PRODUCTS IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT, (II) ANY USE OF THE PRODUCTS BY CUSTOMER IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK, (III) PROVIDER, ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER IN ANY WAY FOR USE OF THE PRODUCTS IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT, AND (IV) PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR ASSURANCES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING USE OF THE PRODUCTS IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT.\\n\\n12.  Infringement Indemnity.  Provider shall indemnify Customer from and against any claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought against Customer by a third party to the extent it is based on an allegation that the Software directly infringes any patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right enforceable in the country in which Provider has authorized Customer to use the Software, including, but not limited to the country to which the Software is delivered to Customer, or misappropriates a trade secret in such country (a “Claim”).  Indemnification for a Claim shall consist of the following: Provider shall (a) defend or settle the Claim at its own expense, (b) pay any judgments finally awarded against Customer under a Claim or any amounts assessed against Customer in any settlements of a Claim, and (c) reimburse Customer for the reasonable administrative costs or expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, it necessarily incurs in responding to the Claim. Provider’s obligations under this Infringement Indemnity Section are conditioned upon Customer (i) giving prompt written notice of the Claim to Provider, (ii) permitting Provider to retain sole control of the investigation, defense or settlement of the Claim, and (iii) providing Provider with cooperation and assistance as Provider may reasonably request in connection with the Claim.

Provider expressly excludes any and all liability to Third Party Users, Clients and to any other third party.\\n\\n14.  Confidential Information.  \\n\\n(a)  Definition.  “Confidential Information” means information or materials disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) that are not generally available to the public and which, due to their character and nature, a reasonable person under like circumstances would treat as confidential, including, without limitation, financial, marketing, and pricing information, trade secrets, know-how, proprietary tools, knowledge and methodologies, the Software (in source code and/or object code form), information or benchmark test results regarding the functionality and performance of the Software, any Software license keys provided to Customer, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  \\n\\nConfidential Information shall not include information or materials that (i) are generally known to the public, other than as a result of an unpermitted disclosure by the Receiving Party after the date that Customer accepts the Agreement (the “Effective Date”); (ii) were known to the Receiving Party without an obligation of confidentiality prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; (iii) the Receiving Party lawfully received from a third party without that third party’s breach of agreement or obligation of trust; (iv) are protected by Provider in accordance with its obligations under the Protected Data Section below, or (v) are or were independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to or use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. \\n\\n(b)  Obligations.  The Receiving Party shall (i) not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third party, except as permitted in subsection (c) below and (ii) protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.  The Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any known unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and will cooperate with the Disclosing Party in any litigation brought by the Disclosing Party against third parties to protect its proprietary rights.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall apply to all disclosures of the parties’ Confidential Information as of the Effective Date, whether or not specifically arising from a party’s performance under this Agreement.\\n\\n(c)  Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent to any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors or representatives (collectively, the “Representatives”), but only to those Representatives that (i) have a “need to know” in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to provide professional advice in connection with this Agreement, (ii) are legally bound to the Receiving Party to protect information such as the Confidential Information under terms at least as restrictive as those provided herein, and (iii) have been informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the requirements regarding restrictions on disclosure and use as set forth in this Section.  The Receiving Party shall be liable to the Disclosing Party for the acts or omissions of any Representatives to which it discloses Confidential Information which, if done by the Receiving Party, would be a breach of this Agreement. \\n\\nAdditionally, it shall not be a breach of this Section for the Receiving Party to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as may be required by operation of law or legal process, provided that the Receiving Party provides prior notice of such disclosure to the Disclosing Party unless expressly prohibited from doing so by a court, arbitration panel or other legal authority of competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n15.\\tProtected Data.  For purposes of this Section, “Protected Data” means any information or data that is provided by Customer to Provider during this Agreement that alone or together with any other information relates to an identified or identifiable natural person or data considered to be personal data as defined under Privacy Laws, and “Privacy Laws” means any applicable law, statute, directive or regulation regarding privacy, data protection, information security obligations and/or the processing of Protected Data.\\n\\nExcept as permitted herein or to the extent required by Privacy Laws or legal process, Provider shall implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of or access to Protected Data by third parties, and shall only store and process Protected Data as may be required to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and any applicable Orders. If Provider complies with Customer’s written instructions with respect to the Protected Data, Provider shall have no liability to Customer for any breach of this Section resulting from such compliance. Provider shall promptly notify Customer of any disclosure of or access to the Protected Data by a third party in breach of this Section and shall cooperate with Customer to reasonably remediate the effects of such disclosure or access. Provider further affirms to Customer that it has adequate agreements in place incorporating the EU standard contractual clauses for the transfer of Protected Data from the European Union (“EU”) to a country outside the EU.  \\n\\nCustomer hereby (i) represents that it has the right to send the Protected Data to Provider, (ii) consents for Provider to store and use the Protected Data worldwide for the sole purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement and any applicable Orders, (iii) agrees that the Protected Data may be accessed and used by Provider and its Representatives worldwide as may be needed to support Provider’s standard business operations, and (iv) agrees that Protected Data consisting of Customer contact information (e.g., email addresses, names) provided as part of Maintenance Services may be sent to Provider’s third party service providers as part of Provider’s services improvement processes.   \\n\\n16.\\tCompliance Verification.  Customer agrees to maintain and use systems and procedures to accurately track, document, and report its installations, acquisitions and usage of the Software.  Such systems and procedures shall be sufficient to determine if Customer’s deployment of the Software or, if applicable, use of the SaaS Software is within the quantities, Product Terms, and maintenance releases to which it is entitled.  Provider or its designated auditing agent shall have the right to audit Customer\u0027s deployment of the Software or, if applicable, use of the SaaS Software for compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Order(s). Any such audits shall be scheduled at least ten (10) days in advance and shall be conducted during normal business hours at Customer\u0027s facilities. Customer shall provide its full cooperation and assistance with such audit and provide access to the applicable records and computers.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as part of the audit, Provider may request, and Customer agrees to provide, a written report, signed by an authorized representative, listing Customer\u0027s then current deployment of On-Premise Software and/or the number of individuals that have accessed and used SaaS Software.  If Customer\u0027s deployment of the Software or, if applicable, use of the SaaS Software is found to be greater than its purchased entitlement to such Software, Customer will be invoiced for the over-deployed quantities at Provider’s then current list price plus the applicable Maintenance Services and applicable over-deployment fees. All such amounts shall be payable in accordance with this Agreement. Additionally, if the unpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the fees paid for the applicable Software, then Customer shall also pay Provider\u0027s reasonable costs of conducting the audit.  The requirements of this Section shall survive for two (2) years following the termination of the last License governed by this Agreement.\\n\\n17.\\tSaaS Provisions.  \\n\\n(a)\\tData. Customer may store data on the systems to which it is provided access in connection with its use of the SaaS Software (the “SaaS Environment”). Provider may periodically make back-up copies of Customer data, however such back-ups are not intended to replace Customer’s obligation to maintain regular data backups or redundant data archives. Customer is solely responsible for collecting, inputting and updating all Customer data stored in the SaaS Environment, and for ensuring that it does not (i) knowingly create and store data that actually or potentially infringes or misappropriates the copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property right of any third party, or (ii) use the SaaS Environment for purposes that would reasonably be seen as obscene, defamatory, harassing, offensive or malicious. If the Order states where Customer data is to be stored, Provider will not move the data from the specified region without notifying Customer, except if Provider is required to do so by law or legal process. Provider shall have the right to delete all Customer data stored in connection with the use of the SaaS Software thirty (30) days following any termination of this Agreement or any License to SaaS Software granted hereunder. \\n\\nCustomer represents and warrants that it has obtained all rights, permissions and consents necessary to use and transfer all Customer and/or third party data within and outside of the country in which Customer or the applicable Customer Affiliate is located (including providing adequate disclosures and obtaining legally sufficient consents from Customer’s employees, customers, agents, and contractors).  If Customer transmits data to a third-party website or other provider that is linked to or made accessible by the SaaS Software, Customer will be deemed to have given its consent to Provider enabling such transmission and Provider shall have no liability to Customer in connection with any claims by a third party in connection with such transmission.\\n\\n(b)\\tConduct.  In connection with the use of SaaS Software, Customer may not (i) attempt to use or gain unauthorized access to Provider’s or to any third-party\u0027s networks or equipment; (ii) permit other individuals or entities to copy the SaaS Software; (iii) provide unauthorized access to or use of any SaaS Software or the associated access credentials; (iv) attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the SaaS Software, the SaaS Environment, or a system, account or network of Provider or any of Provider’s customers or suppliers; (v) interfere or attempt to interfere with service to any user, host or network; (vi) engage in fraudulent, offensive or illegal activity of any nature or intentionally engage in any activity that infringes the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any individual or third party; (vii) transmit unsolicited bulk or commercial messages; (viii) intentionally distribute worms, Trojan horses, viruses, corrupted files or any similar items; (ix) restrict, inhibit, or otherwise interfere with the ability of any other person, regardless of intent, purpose or knowledge, to use or enjoy the SaaS Software (except for tools with safety and security functions); or (x) restrict, inhibit, interfere with or otherwise disrupt or cause a performance degradation to any Provider (or Provider supplier) facilities used to provide the SaaS Environment. Customer shall cooperate with Provider’s reasonable investigation of SaaS Environment outages, security issues, and any suspected breach of this Section, and shall, at its expense, defend Provider and its Affiliates from any claim, suit, or action by a third party (a “Third Party Claim”) alleging harm to such third party caused by Customer’s breach of any of the provisions of this Section.  Additionally, Customer shall pay any judgments or settlements reached in connection with the Third Party Claim as well as Provider’s costs of responding to the Third Party Claim. \\n\\n(c)\\tSuspension. Provider may suspend Customer’s use of SaaS Software (a) if so required by law enforcement or legal process, (b) in the event of an imminent security risk to Provider or its customers, or (c) if continued use would subject Provider to material liability.  Provider shall make commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide prior notice to Customer of any such suspension.\\n\\n18.  General.  \\n\\n(a)\\tGoverning Law and Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that would require the application of laws of a different state.  Any action seeking enforcement of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the Orange County, California. Each party hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. \\n\\nThe parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) shall apply to this Agreement, regardless of the states in which the parties do business or are incorporated.  \\n\\n(b)\\tAssignment. Except as otherwise set forth herein, Customer shall not, in whole or part, assign or transfer any part of this Agreement, the Licenses granted under this Agreement or any other rights, interest or obligations hereunder, whether voluntarily, by contract, by operation of law or by merger (whether that party is the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or order, or otherwise without the prior written consent of Provider.  Any attempted transfer or assignment by Customer that is not permitted by this Agreement shall be null and void.  \\n\\n(c)\\tSeverability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible by law to effect the intent of the parties and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement that limit, disclaim, or exclude warranties, remedies or damages are intended by the parties to be independent and remain in effect despite the failure or unenforceability of an agreed remedy. The parties have relied on the limitations and exclusions set forth in this Agreement in determining whether to enter into it.\\n\\n(d)\\tUse by U.S. Government.  The Software is a “commercial item” under FAR 12.201. Consistent with FAR section 12.212 and DFARS section 227.7202, any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure or distribution of the Software or Documentation by the U.S. government is prohibited except as expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. In addition, when Customer is a U.S. government entity, the language in Subsection (ii) of the Infringement Indemnity Section of this Agreement and the Injunctive Relief Section of this Agreement shall not be applicable.\\n\\n(e)\\tNotices. All notices provided hereunder shall be in writing and addressed to the legal department of the respective party or to such other address as may be specified in an Order or in writing by either of the parties to the other in accordance with this Section. Except as may be expressly permitted herein, notices may be delivered personally, sent via a nationally recognized courier or overnight delivery service, or mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid.  All notices, requests, demands or communications shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or, if sent by mail, four (4) days following deposit in the mail in accordance with this paragraph.\\n\\n(f)\\tDisclosure of Customer Status. Provider may include Customer in its listing of customers and, upon written consent by Customer, announce Customer\u0027s selection of Provider in its marketing communications. \\n\\n(g)\\tWaiver. Performance of any obligation required by a party hereunder may be waived only by a written waiver signed by an authorized representative of the other party, which waiver shall be effective only with respect to the specific obligation described therein. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.\\n\\n(h)\\tInjunctive Relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a material breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to a breach of the Software License, Restrictions or Confidential Information Sections of this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief, without limiting its other rights and remedies.\\n\\n(i)\\tForce Majeure. Each party will be excused from performance for any period during which, and to the extent that, it is prevented from performing any obligation or service as a result of causes beyond its reasonable control, and without its fault or negligence, including without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, communication line failures, and power failures. For added certainty, this Section shall not operate to change, delete, or modify any of the parties’ obligations under this Agreement (e.g., payment), but rather only to excuse a delay in the performance of such obligations. \\n\\n(j)\\tEqual Opportunity.. Provider is a federal contractor and Affirmative Action employer (M/F/D/V) as required by the Equal Opportunity clause C.F.R. § 60-741.5(a).\\n\\n(k)\\tHeadings. Headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement will not be construed either in favor of or against one party or the other, but rather in accordance with its fair meaning. When the term “including” is used in this Agreement it will be construed in each case to mean “including, but not limited to.”\\n\\n(l)  \\tLegal Fees.  If any legal action is brought to enforce any rights or obligations under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and other collection expenses, in addition to any other relief it may be awarded.\\n\\n(m)\\tEntire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement unless such agreement is signed by both parties.  In the absence of such an agreement, this Agreement and the applicable Signed Order or Governing Quotation shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions and no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any judicial or arbitral proceeding that may involve the Agreement.    Each party acknowledges that in entering into the Agreement it has not relied on, and shall have no right or remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently) other than as expressly set out in the Agreement. In those jurisdictions where an original (non-faxed, non-electronic, or non-scanned) copy of an agreement or an original (non-electronic) signature on agreements such as this Agreement or an Order is required by law or regulation, the parties hereby agree that, notwithstanding any such law or regulation, a faxed, electronic, or scanned copy of and a certified electronic signature on this Agreement or any Order shall be sufficient to create an enforceable and valid agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms contained in an Order, the terms of a Signed Order or Governing Quotation shall control; for all other Orders, the terms of this Agreement shall control.   Neither this Agreement, nor an Order, may be modified or amended except by a writing executed by a duly authorized representative of each party.  No other act, document, usage or custom shall be deemed to amend or modify this Agreement or an Order. \\n    \\n\\n\\nUSSTA20170601.1\\tCONFIDENTIAL\\tPage 9 of 9\\n\\n\\n\",\"privacyPolicy\":\"http://quest.com/legal/privacy.aspx\",\"payloadLength\":136367956338,\"productKind\":\"virtualMachine\",\"productProperties\":{\"version\":\"620.0.0\"}}},{\"id\":\"/subscriptions/74c72bdc-d917-431c-a377-8ca80f4238a0/resourceGroups/azurestack-activation/providers/Microsoft.AzureBridge.Admin/activations/default/downloadedProducts/rds.remote-desktop-services-basic-deploymentdev-test-1.0.3\",\"name\":\"default/rds.remote-desktop-services-basic-deploymentdev-test-1.0.3\",\"type\":\"Microsoft.AzureBridge.Admin/activations/downloadedProducts\",\"etag\":\"W/\\\"datetime\u00272019-04-20T16%3A10%3A52.1305451Z\u0027\\\"\",\"properties\":{\"displayName\":\"Remote Desktop Services (RDS) - Basic - Dev/Test\",\"description\":\"\u003cp\u003eRemote Desktop Services (RDS) is the platform of choice to cost-effectively host Windows desktops and applications.

They make this environment accessible through their Patented BCaaS™ system, lowering barriers to entry on cloud applications and infrastructure by eliminating downtime.  \\n\u003cbr\u003eThe downtime risks of cloud-based solutions mirror those of traditional IT systems: unplanned outages, failure of storage availability architectures, VMs, or servers. Application migration processes can introduce additional burdens including service interruptions, loss of in-flight transactions, configuration, synch up, and performance issues. Since disaster recovery systems can take days to restore critical services and in-flight data may never be recaptured, DR is clearly not the answer. Nor are outsourced hosting agreements any guarantee of uptime. True business continuity requires the capability to process active-active critical applications in multiple availability zones across different clouds or platforms. \\n\\nZeroDown’s patented technology provides this simple, easy and secure solution to ensure that applications are up and running continuously. All application instances are hot, making everything equally and simultaneously available across multiple locations in real time. If one instance goes down, the others will continue to function with no customer impacts or operational disruptions. Since live transactions and data are being synched up continuously, applications can be rolled back to any available site, providing the optimal business continuity solution for multi-cloud deployments.\\n\",\"publisherDisplayName\":\"ZeroDown Software\",\"publisherIdentifier\":\"zerodown_software\",\"provisioningState\":\"Succeeded\",\"offer\":\"stackbcaas\",\"offerVersion\":\"13\",\"sku\":\"stackzdsbcaas\",\"billingPartNumber\":\"\",\"galleryItemIdentity\":\"zerodown_software.stackbcaasstackzdsbcaas.1.0.2\",\"iconUris\":{\"hero\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/zerodown_software.stackbcaasstackzdsbcaas-1.0.0/20f13810723f4f8d95213538b74b1dfc/Hero\",\"large\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/zerodown_software.stackbcaasstackzdsbcaas-1.0.0/42818f66ecfe424c98351d68d44b9c15/Large\",\"wide\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/zerodown_software.stackbcaasstackzdsbcaas-1.0.0/60e16a93e3984210958e7903099af7b2/Wide\",\"medium\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/zerodown_software.stackbcaasstackzdsbcaas-1.0.0/ad425c9f975d40cfb0f809ea391ff073/Medium\",\"small\":\"https://azurebridgerp.blob.northwest.azs-longhaul-02.selfhost.corp.microsoft.com:443/producticons/zerodown_software.stackbcaasstackzdsbcaas-1.0.0/6786ea105928454f881d59d47a1f74a1/Small\"},\"links\":[],\"legalTerms\":\"LICENSE AGREEMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nZeroNines™ Technology, Inc.
